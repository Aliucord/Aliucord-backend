        <p>Aliucord is a customizable Discord client that offers a wide range of features and functionality beyond
            what's available in the standard Discord client. With Aliucord, users can customize their Discord
            experience to suit their needs and preferences, from changing the look and feel of the app to adding new
            features and integrations.</p>

            <p>Client modifications are against Discord's Terms of Service. However, Discord is pretty indifferent about
                them and there are no known cases of users getting banned for using client mods. So you should generally
                be fine as long as you don't use plugins that bypass api restrictions or implement spammy / selfbot
                behaviour (mass deleting, spam plugins, etc).</p>
            <p>Regardless, if your account is very important to you and it getting disabled would be a disaster for you,
                you should probably not use client mods.</p>
            <p>Additionally, make sure not to post screenshots with Aliucord in a server where you might get banned or
                reported for it.</p>

            <p>Every Android app is signed with a signature by its developer. This way Android can confirm an apk comes
                from a credible source and wasn't tampered with. Because Aliucord is built locally on your device, that
                also means it is signed locally on your device, with a signature created just for you. This means that
                the signature of your Aliucord app is unique and Google doesn't recognise it. Thus</p>
